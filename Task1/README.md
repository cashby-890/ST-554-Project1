Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

- Feedback from Max Campbell
  + My main piece of feedback is that I think that some of the narrative aspects of the write-up could be re-phrased to be a bit more explanatory, so that we suit the write-up to our target audience more precisely. For example, in Method 1.1, you say: "The logic behind this method: generate a list of different c values..." While all the content is there, the structure of it could potentially leave a reader from our target audience (a person who understands the basics, but would need further explanation for more advanced concepts) with questions about the process. Going back to the example, we could instead say "The logic behind this method is that we are aiming to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) by using a grid search algorithm. A grid search algorithm creates a sequence of values `c` which we are calling a grid..." and so on.
  + There a few missing words/typos throughout, I'd just make sure to proofread everything before we submit. Most of the ones I noticed were in Method 1.1
  + In general, I don't see any glaring errors in your code and the logic all seems sound. In terms of the formatting, I notice that you nest functions within other functions a lot. It might be easier to read the code itself if you bring the nested functions out into the main level, but that could just be more preferential than anything. Beyond that, great job on this!
  + I don't think this is required at all, but I think it would be cool to compare the accuracy of the algorithms to each other in some manner. For example, you could compare how each valid method performs for one (or more) of the variables in the data. It would make for a fitting conclusion!
  +  Overall, good job! I think you're in a good spot.



- Feedback from Cody Ashby
  + After reading through the section on the grid search algorithm, it looks fairly solid outside of a few typographical errors in the narrative (e.g. missing words that could interrupt the reading flow, incorrect spelling, etc.). Personally, I think having a text cell in between code cells would be beneficial in keeping with the Good Programming Practices that's strongly encouraged in courses like thsse, even if it means a short sentence describing what you're about to do. I'm still learning the ropes on these GPPs myself, though, so there might be more pressing issues on that front.
  + I also think the context of the narrative itself may be a bit too technical for the target audience. Simplifying some of the verbiage in describing the algorithm
