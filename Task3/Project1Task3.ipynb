        "# Cross-Validating across Time using Multiple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "A major challenge of modeling data that is collected over time is that there is likely to be correlation between consecutive entries. This poses problems because a key assumption that is made when fitting a linear regression model is that the observations are independent of one another. In order to work around this, we can instead evaluate the model by taking the first subset of observations (ordered by time), forecasting the next observation and recording the mean squared error. We can repeat this process, obtain the sum of the mean squared errors, and now we have a metric by which we can \"cross-validate\" the model!\n",
        "\n",
        "We will write an algorithm to demonstrate this process using Python. Data for this particular example is air quality data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The observations were collected between March 2004 to February 2005 and data was collected using metal oxide chemical sensors that were embedded in a device located in a significantly polluted area in Italy. More information on the dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)."
